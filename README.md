API USERS CRUD ENCRYPTED
User CRUD API where the following libraries were implemented:
• Json Web Token for token generation to secure and access private endpoints.
• Bcrypt for generating encrypted passwords, handling password creation when a new user is created, and comparing the entered password with the encrypted password during login.
• Nodemailer for sending emails to users for account verification and password reset.
